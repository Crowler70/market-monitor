This is a simple app which 
- Let's user choose a stock/company/ETF from NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges

- shows ptions info table closest to stock price with color codes (green-ITM, white-OTM)
- any recent news about the underlying organization

Its updated live and uses the [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/), [finviz](https://github.com/mariostoev/finviz) API in backend.
